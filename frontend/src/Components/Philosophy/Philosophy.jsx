          At T4T, we believe in redefining education and empowering learners to take control of their own learning journey. We reject traditional, top-down systems of education and embrace a model built on the principles of decentralization, collaboration, and community. Just as Web3 challenges the conventional systems of technology and finance, we challenge the traditional ways of learning.
